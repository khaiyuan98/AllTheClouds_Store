# All The Clouds Online Store

This project is a submission for the technical assessment for City Facilities. The solution has two components – a “front-end” and a “back-end”.

- Front-end: OnlineStore_React_Web (React Web + Vite)
- Back-end: Web API (ASP.NET Core Web API using .NET 7.0)

## The Problem

You work for a company that is a reseller for a vendor that sells cloud products. The vendor provides an API at
http://alltheclouds.com.au. Your company would like to build an application that allows your customers to view the
available products and their prices and to make orders.
- API documentation is available http://alltheclouds.com.au/docs/
- You can get an API key http://alltheclouds.com.au/api-key (NOTE: Enter Name = Test, Email = test@test.com)

## User Story

to order.

## Acceptance Criteria
